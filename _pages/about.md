Currently a student in Master II [Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/m2-mathematique-et-intelligence-artificielle/) at Paris-Saclay University, I'm developing fundamental and practical skills in statistics, probability, optimization, machine learning and deep learning.

I am particularly interested in the field of Reinforcement Learning (single and multi agents) and Online Learning more generally. I am not only motivated by the expansion of knowledge and capacities, I also take interest in the questions linked to AI Safety, both on a technical point of view and an ethical one.
I am very much interested to do a PhD in one of those hot topics and I am actively looking for such an opportunity !

In addition to my current degree, I also hold a double bachelor in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Paris-Saclay which has the particularity of having its third year physics courses shared with the ENS Paris-Saclay and the "Magist√®re de Physique fondamentale" of the University of Paris-Saclay which are two of the most fundamental curriculum in physics in France.
Thanks to my scientific background in physics, I remain very interested and curious in the various discoveries and areas of research in physics, in particular the questions of controlled nuclear fusion for civil use and quantum computing.

On my spare time, I do sports to respect the saying "A healthy mind in a healthy body"! I really appreciate to go hiking or climbing with friends, wether is it indoor or on the outside. 
I deeply appreciate the mountain environment for the rusticity it requires and the humility it imposes.

I intend to continue to progress and gain skills in order to be able to see and do as many things as possible, both professionally and personally!
