I am a PhD student at [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), focusing on the security of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks within the [SAMOVAR](https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/index.php/en/accueil-2/) lab. My research is part of the [PEPR Future Networks](https://pepr-futurenetworks.fr/en/the-pepr/) initiative, a strategic program dedicated to advancing research and development in 5G and B5G technologies.

I am focused on Reinforcement Learning and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with my background in physics fuelling my curiosity about how quantum computing could revolutionize these computationally demanding fields.  
I am motivated not only by the pursuit of expanding knowledge and technological capabilities but also by a deep commitment to AI safety, from both technical and ethical perspectives. I enjoy working at the intersection of fundamental and applied research, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical innovations and their practical applications.

I hold a Master’s degree in [Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/m2-mathematique-et-intelligence-artificielle/) from Paris-Saclay University, where I developed a strong foundation in statistics, probability, optimization, machine learning, and deep learning.

Additionally, I hold a double Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Paris-Saclay. The third-year physics courses of this program were shared with the prestigious ENS Paris-Saclay and the "Magistère de Physique Fondamentale," known for being among the most rigorous physics curricula in France. My background in physics continues to drive my interest in cutting-edge research areas such as quantum computing and controlled nuclear fusion for civilian use.
