Currently a PhD student at [IP Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), I am focusing on the security of Reinforcement Learning (RL) models for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks at the [SAMOVAR](https://samovar.telecom-sudparis.eu/index.php/en/accueil-2/) lab. My PhD is part of the [PEPR Future Networks](https://pepr-futurenetworks.fr/en/the-pepr/) initiative, a strategic program aimed at advancing research and development in 5G and Beyond 5G technologies. 
\\ This program brings together academic institutions, research labs, and industry partners to foster innovation and address the technical, security, and ethical challenges associated with next-generation mobile networks.

 I hold a Master degree in [Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/etudiants/masters/mathematiques-et-applications/m2/m2-mathematique-et-intelligence-artificielle/) from Paris-Saclay University, where I developed fundamental and practical skills in statistics, probability, optimization, machine learning, and deep learning.

I am particularly interested in the fields of Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Online Learning. I am intrigued by the possibilities that quantum computing could bring to these resource-intensive fields. My motivation is driven not only by the expansion of knowledge and capabilities but also by a deep interest in AI Safety from both technical and ethical perspectives.
\\ I appreciate working at the edge between fundamental and applied research, bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical applications.

In addition to my Master's degree, I also hold a double bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Paris-Saclay. Notably, the third-year physics courses in this program are shared with the prestigious ENS Paris-Saclay and the "Magist√®re de Physique fondamentale," which are among the most rigorous physics curricula in France.

Thanks to my strong background in physics, I remain interested and curious about various discoveries and research areas in the field, particularly in quantum computing and controlled nuclear fusion for civil use.

Have a look at my [CV](http://alex-pierron.github.io/files/pierron_cv.pdf) for additional information!

On my spare time, I do sports to respect the saying "A healthy mind in a healthy body"! I really appreciate to go hiking or climbing with friends, wether is it indoor or on the outside. 
I deeply appreciate the mountain environment for the rusticity it requires and the humility it imposes.

I intend to continue to progress and gain skills in order to be able to see and do as many things as possible, both professionally and personally!
